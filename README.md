## Updates

- (June, 2022) We released SPOT training and inference code for ActivityNetv1.3 dataset.
- (June, 2022) SPOT is accepted by ECCV 2022.

## Summary
- First single-stage proposal-free framework for Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Detection (SS-TAD) task.
- Being single-stage, it does not suffers from the notorius Proposal Error Propagation problem.
- Proposed a novel pre-text task for Action Detection based on the notion of Random Foreground.
- A novel Boundary Refinement strategy is proposed based on contrastive learning.
- With just 10% labeled videos majority of the existing TAD approaches are surpassed in terms of performance. 

## Abstract

Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on a large number of training data with segment-level annotations. Collecting and annotating such a training set is thus highly expensive and unscalable. Semi-supervised TAD (SS-TAD) alleviates this problem by leveraging unlabeled videos freely available at scale. However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem than supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods directly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method. Due to their sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, they are prone to proposal error propagation. To overcome this limitation, in this work we propose a novel Semi-supervised Temporal action detection model based on PropOsal-free Temporal mask (SPOT) with a parallel localization (mask generation) and classification architecture. Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by cutting off the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and localization for prediction refinement, and a new pretext task for self-supervised model pre-training. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show that our SPOT outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin.

## Getting Started

### GPUClient Environment Setup
```shell script
python -m venv myenv # Python 3.8
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r req.txt
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.7
- PyTorch == 1.9.0  **(Please make sure your pytorch version is atleast 1.8)**
- NVIDIA GPU
- Kornia


### Environment Setup
It is suggested to create a Conda environment and install the following requirements
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Features
Download the video features and update the Video paths/output paths in ``` config/anet.yaml ``` file. For now ActivityNetv1.3 dataset config is available. We are planning to release the code for THUMOS14 dataset soon.

### Model Training 
![](asserts/CVPR22_fig3_v2.png)

To train SPOT from scratch run the following command. The training configurations can be adjusted from  ``` config/anet.yaml ``` file.
This training includes both Pre-training and the fine-tuning stages.
```shell script
python spot_train.py
```
### Model Inference
We provide the pretrained models containing the checkpoint for I3D features on ActivityNetv1.3 . It can be found in the [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltF5AKee8JcdJmDPabJtXwJe1_m0X3Sc/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading the checkpoints, the checkpoints path can be saved in ``` config/anet.yaml ``` file.
The model inference can be then performed using the following command 
```shell script
python spot_inference.py
```
### Model Evaluation
To evaluate our TAGS model run the following command. 
```shell script
python eval.py
```

### TO-DO Checklist
- [ ] Support for THUMOS14 dataset
- [ ] Enable multi-gpu training
